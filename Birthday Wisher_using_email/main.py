# HINT 3: Use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary from birthday.csv that is formated like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (birthday_month, birthday_day): data_row
# }
#Dictionary comprehension template for pandas DataFrame looks like this:
birthdays_dict = {(data_row["month"],data_row["day"]): data_row for (index, data_row) in data.iterrows()}
#e.g. if the birthdays.csv looked like this:
# name,email,year,month,day
# Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
#Then the birthdays_dict should look like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (12, 24): Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
# }

#HINT 4: Then you could compare and see if today's month/day tuple matches one of the keys in birthday_dict like this:
if today_tuple in birthdays_dict:
    birthdays_person = birthdays_dict[today_tuple]
    file_path = f"letter_templates/letter_{random.randint(1,3)}.txt"
    with open(file_path) as letter_file:
        content = letter_file.read()
        content = content.replace("[NAME]",birthdays_person["name"])

        connection.sendmail(from_addr=my_email,
                            to_addrs=birthdays_person["email"],
                            msg=f"Subject:HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\n\n {content}"
                            )
